In the instructional programme, Assessment for Learning (AfL) strategies are adopted as a school-wide teaching and learning approach to develop our students to be self-directed. Our Applied Learning Programme (ALP) is supported by the Science Centre and serves as a platform to guide and expose our students in the area of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) which they learn to appreciate the relevance and value of what they learn in the academic curriculum. Students will have the opportunity to build an Underwater Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) from scratch while learning to work in teams. This builds up students' skills in thinking, self-directing, problem-solving and decision-making. In Secondary 2, they will be taught coding and they will attempt to apply it on their ROV. Secondary 3 students are exposed to a wider range of STEM industries via Learning Journeys, Elective Modules and Advanced Elective Modules. In addition, Regent's Learning for Life Programme (LLP) adopts a whole-school approach to develop student's character, leadership and spirit for volunteering. The approach is achieved through our school's Student Leadership Programme and the Values-in-Action Programme (for youth volunteerism development). The Student Leadership programme equips our students with the attitude, knowledge and skills to lead self, peers and community. The Values-in-Action programme provides our students with the platforms and opportunities to take action and make a difference in school and community. Other enrichment programmes provided include the Mathematics & Science Olympiad. We are increasing opportunities for students to initiate VIA activities so that our students will be able to lead change in causes they are passionate about.",

For our Catholic boys, we have programmes catered for them including Religious & Moral Education lessons and regular Eucharistic celebrations.

To meet future challenges, our students must extend their learning beyond the acquisition of knowledge and skills, and apply and use their learning in meaningful ways.  Established since 1959, Teck Whye Primary envisions our learners to achieve the following outcomes and exercise the related values in their daily lives:   Confident Communicators who Engage with Respect   Healthy Individuals who eXercise Responsibility   Adaptive Leaders who Collaborate with Integrity   Model Citizens who Encourage through Compassion   Passionate Learners who Learn with Resilience The rallying call is for CHAMPs who embrace and strive for the value of Excellence.

He must agrow up, a dignified individual and a caring leader who contributes actively to the community in his own capacity. We believe that every child must develop the spirit of adventure to explore and pursue his interests, his talents, and his imagination, his sense of curiosity and wonder.  He must also develop his cognitive and linguistic abilities to express his thoughts and opinions confidently and critically.  Importantly, he must grow up with the disposition and ability to learn, unlearn and relearn so that he will be well placed in secondary school, and for the future. We believe that every child must find joy in learning and be inspired to be the best that he can be, and to achieve the best that he can in his learning. He should set high expectations for himself in his pursuits of his interests and talents and find his sense of purpose and meaningfulness in what he wishes to do or to grow up to become. We believe that every child learns best when the environment is safe and nurturing; and he is free to express himself: his needs, his aspirations, his thoughts and his feelings. The learning environment should also encourage him to interact with one another through which he learns to appreciate diverse perspectives and ideas, the needs of others and itheir interests. We believe in the growth mindset that the child can achieve far more than what we can imagine because every child can learn and find success, given the right conditions. We will affirm every child's efforts to learn and guide him in his pursuits.  We believe that success is defined more than mere grades or scores; it is about developing the whole child. As educators in FPPS, every child that passes through our hands is special; each different, each with hopes and dreams, everyone important.",

"special_sdp_offered": "FPPS has two distinctive programmes (LLP & ALP). Put together, the programmes develop confident persons and caring leaders in our students.  Our ALP, iDREaM, a 6-year programme, uses drama to empower students to think critically and develop their own voice in response to different experiences.  All FPPS students attend process drama lessons during which they explore complex real world issues. Teachers will then facilitate discussions on these issues with the aim to provide students opportunities to articulate their opinions and thinking, using evidence from the text to support their reasoning and decisions. Through process drama, students develop critical and inventive thinking skills, sound and logical reasoning skills and become confident, self-assured individuals. They also learn to appreciate different perspectives through active listening. In FPPS, ALP cuts both English and Mother-Tongue languages. FPPS collaborates with external partners such as Singapore Polytechnic to provide our students greater opportunities to learn through drama.    Our LLP, iCARE, a 6-year developmental programme, develops students to be Caring, Adaptable, Responsible and Enterprising Leaders of Tomorrow.  Through iCARE our students grow up to be concerned citizens and active contributors, and learn to give time and effort to reach out to others in need. Hence, students are given meaningful and authentic experiences to develop and demonstrate their leadership skills. Students with greater leadership potential are given opportunities to hone their leadership skills by initiating, planning and executing various projects, targeting at serving the school and community such as initiating and planning visits to old folks' homes, and to other communities in need.  In iCARE, teachers faciitate students' learning through individual and individual reflections to deepen their learning about self, others and their role in the community.",

LEADERS OF CHARACTER: Grounded on the TKGS leadership philosophy where leadership is not about rank, position or title but towards the service of others, our signature 4-year ViA programme guides all students to take the lead in exploring and deciding the causes they want to champion. Students are supported in such endeavours through practices picked up in lessons facilitated by teachers and working with external partners who all believe in the mission of nurturing TKGians to be leaders. In also believing that every student can lead in her own way, various leadership opportunities within our vibrant student body grow each TKGian to flourish in her own ways. ACCOMPLISHED LEARNERS: The TKGS Academic Curriculum integrates tasks which deepen disciplinary thinking and encourage explorations beyond the syllabus. We take special pride in our rich culture of EL learning, where the school serves as the East Zone Centre of Excellence. Besides being guided to take up a high level of personal responsibility towards their own learning by planning consultations and collaborations outside of class, TKGians can look forward to stretching themselves through the TKGS+ programme, to lead their peers in academic learning and exercise stewardship of their gifts. WOMEN OF GRACE: With a rich tradition in the Performing Arts, we are known for students who enjoy initiating their own performances and engaging with different audiences and fellow performers. Other than the opportunity to pursue Art, Music & Drama at the O levels, our 5 distinguished Performing Arts CCA groups provides for a vibrant Performing Arts scene - not just within the school but also beyond.",

With the purpose to develop independent learners, confident thinkers and innovators, 'TIPpers' are stretched to further hone academic skills and student leadership ability.

These values are taught through narratives and stories allowing students to discuss and internalise the values. To complement what is taught in the classroom, the Values Portal is prepared specially for parents to engage their child in further conversations at home. Other activities include Camp Achiever, a school-wide camp, and the Ceremonial Walk through the Values Gateway, which serves to enable students to imbibe school values and symbolises Nanhuarians embracing the school values respectively. CnME is a school-developed curriculum where our students develop 21st century competencies as they explore areas of interest. Anchored in the guiding principle POTENTIAL (Providing Opportunities To Engage and Nurture Talent In Academic areas of Learning), the curriculum has elements of collaborative work, research and ICT skills and a focus on creativity.",

Sec 1 students would draw up proposals to improve the school environment; Sec 2 students spread environmental conservation messages as HDB Heartland Ambassadors and connect with the community by leading in learning journeys to Punggol Ecotown; Sec 3 students conduct service learning activities locally  and the Sec 4/5 students mentor their juniors in fund raising for Singapore Heart Foundation and Boy's Town flag day. Our structured Aesthetics Programme aims to develop our students into refined young men and women capable of appreciating the Arts or participating in performances. 'Building Character and School Pride through Volleyball' is a special programme in our school that aims to develop resilience, tenacity, and leadership in our students.  With our specialised and customised training, many of our school team players have qualified to be in school teams in polytechnics and junior colleges. Starting 2019, the school will offer Mobile Robotics to Sec 3NT students as a N-level subject.",
